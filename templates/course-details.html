                                        <h3>The Mastercard Foundation (MCF)</h3>

                                        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>

                                        <p><a href="http://www.mastercardfdn.org/">The Mastercard Foundation</a>&nbsp;is
                                            an independent foundation based in Toronto, Canada. It is one of the largest
                                            private foundations in the world. Through its work with partner
                                            organizations, it provides greater access to education, skills training and
                                            financial services for people living in poverty, primarily in Sub-Saharan
                                            Africa.</p>

                                        <p>The Foundation was established as an independent entity in 2006 by MasterCard
                                            Worldwide when it became a public company. No company executives serve on
                                            the Foundation’s Board of Directors. All decisions are determined by the
                                            Foundation’s Board of Directors and President and CEO.</p>

                                        <h3>PRIORITISING AFRICA</h3>

                                        <p>The Foundation’s programs are serving more than 6 million people in 49
                                            developing countries. Our funding and partnerships are concentrated in 26
                                            countries in Africa and provide a combination of skills-building, education,
                                            employment and access to financial services.</p>

                                        <p>The continent is home to the world’s youngest population, seven of the
                                            world’s 10 fastest growing economies, and an emerging movement of dynamic
                                            entrepreneurs. There are now 600 million people under the age of 25. By
                                            2045, that number will double. This generation has an unprecedented
                                            opportunity to lead the profound transformation. The world is looking at
                                            Africa afresh.</p>

                                        <p>However, challenges to realizing this potential remain. Tens of millions of
                                            people on the continent lack access to financial services, are unable to
                                            obtain quality education, or cannot take advantage of opportunities to move
                                            out of poverty. These women and men are unable to participate in the global
                                            economy.</p>

                                        <p>We have chosen to contribute to the new story of an inclusive, more equitable
                                            Africa. We are encouraging collaboration and network-building among our
                                            partners so that proven models and approaches can be scaled. We believe this
                                            will allow people to create their own pathways out of poverty.</p>

                                        <h3>PROGRAM AREAS</h3>

                                        <p><strong>Financial Inclusion</strong></p>

                                        <p>The goal of the Financial Inclusion Program is to improve the well-being of

                                        <p>The goal of this program is to enable young people to transition to
                                            employment. It provides out-of-school, unemployed young people with
                                            market-relevant skills, connections to employers, and access to financial
                                            services.</p>

                                            educate and prepare young people – particularly from Africa – to lead change
                                            and make a positive social impact in their communities.</p>

                                            Technology which was established by a Government Ordinance on 6th October,
                                            1951The College was officially opened on 22nd January, 1952 with 200 Teacher
                                            Training students transferred from Achimota College in Accra at the coast,
                                            to form the nucleus of this new College 250 kilometers up country in the
                                            forest belt.</p>

                                        <p>In October, 1952, the School of Engineering and the Department of Commerce
                                            were established and the first students were admitted. From 1952 to 1955,
                                            the School of Engineering prepared students for professional qualifications
                                            only. In 1955, the School embarked on courses leading to the University of
                                            London Bachelor of Engineering External Degree Examinations.</p>

                                        <p>A Pharmacy Department was established in January, 1953, with the transfer of
                                            the former School of Pharmacy from Korle-Bu Hospital, Accra, to the College.
                                            The Department ran a two-year comprehensive course in Pharmacy leading to
                                            the award of the Pharmacy Board Certificate.</p>

                                        <p>A Department of Agriculture was opened in the same year to provide a number
                                            of ad hoc courses of varying duration, from a few terms to three years, for
                                            the Ministry of Agriculture. A Department of General Studies was also
                                            instituted to prepare students for the Higher School Certificate
                                            Examinations (Advance&nbsp; level) in both Science and Arts subjects and to
                                            give instruction in such subjects as were requested by the other departments
                                            to make successful candidates eligible for&nbsp; degree courses they offer.

                                        <p>Once established, the College began to grow and in 1957, the School of
                                            Architecture, Town Planning and Building was inaugurated and its first
                                            students were admitted in January, 1958, for professional courses in
                                            Architecture, Town Planning and Building Technology. As the College
                                            expanded, it was decided to make the Kumasi College of Technology a purely
                                            science and technology institution. In pursuit of this policy, the Teacher
                                            Training College, with the exception of the Art School (considered as
                                            running Technological programs), was transferred in January, 1958, to the
                                            Winneba Training College (whose nucleus has become part of the present day
                                            University of Education Winneba)., In 1959, the Commerce Department was
                                            transferred to Achimota to form the nucleus of the present School of

                                        <p>In December, 1960, the Government of Ghana appointed a University Commission
                                            to advise it on the future development of University Education in Ghana, in
                                            connection with the proposal to transform both the University College of
                                            Ghana and the Kumasi College of Technology into two independent Universities
                                            in Ghana.</p>

                                        <p>Following the report of the commission which came out early 1961, the Kumasi
                                            College of Technology was thus transformed into a full-fledged University

                                            after the military coup d'état of 24th February, 1966 which overthrew the

                                            another act of Parliament, Act 559 of 1998, the University has reverted to

                                            terms “the short 60 years “of its existence become an important centre for
                                            the training of scientists and technologists not only for Ghana, but also
                                            for other African countries as well as other parts of the world. The
                                            University started awarding its own degrees in June 1964.&nbsp; Sixty years
                                            down the lane, the University has kept the tradition of getting all degree
                                            examinations reviewed by external examiners and moderators to ensure that
                                            high academic standards are maintained.</p>

                                        <h3>The New KNUST</h3>

                                        <p><a href="http://www.knust.edu.gh/">KNUST</a>&nbsp;has, since January 2005,
                                            transformed from its previous centralized system of administration into
                                            significantly and progressively decentralizing form in a Collegiate System.
                                            Under this system, the various faculties and departments have been condensed
                                            into six largely autonomous Colleges.</p>

                                        <p>Since its inception, the University had been administered on a Faculty-based
                                            system. This naturally led to a situation, as the university expanded from a
                                            few hundred students into the present 40,000+ students, in which new
                                            Faculties and Institutes were created to meet the ever-growing academic
                                            pursuits of students. The resultant collection of Faculties largely hampered
                                            efficient administrative and academic operations, as duplication of efforts
                                            and long administrative processes were rampant.</p>

                                        <p>The need to deal with these complexities and harmonize the operation of the
                                            existing structures became apparent and unavoidable so the creation of
                                            Colleges to align related faculties and Departments. True to the vision to
                                            make&nbsp;<a href="http://www.knust.edu.gh/">KNUST</a>&nbsp;the model for
                                            technological education in Africa and succeeding Vice-Chancellors’
                                            commitment to academic excellence, the Collegiate System came into being
                                            with the promulgation of the new statutes on November 29, 2004.</p>

                                        <p>Each college is headed by an administrative head, the Provost, supported by
                                            the Deans of Faculties, Heads of Department, College Registrars, College
                                            Accountants and College Librarians. Under these Provosts, key university
                                            functions such as Matriculation, Orientation of freshmen and Congregations
                                            are decentralized</p>

                                        <p>These changes are progressively dynamic and for the 2014/2015 academic year,
                                            the College of Art which since 2014 been grouped with College of Arts and
                                            Social Sciences is to join the College of Architecture and Planning as a
                                            more natural fit.</p>
